## v1.5.5

Snippet Import — full import functionality with JSON/TXT support, preview, validation, and diagnostics.

- Added `SnippetImporter` module with complete import workflow
- JSON import supports flat arrays, `{private: [], broadcast: []}` format, and `{text: "..."}` object entries
- TXT import uses existing `# PRIVATE` / `# BROADCAST` section markers
- File type auto-detected from extension (`.json` or `.txt`)
- Duplicate detection against existing snippets before import

## v1.5.4

Dashboard Accuracy Fix — delay resolution, display improvements, diagnostics enrichment.

- Fixed `StateManager.getDelayValue` to find the actual configured delay (most frequent non-zero value) instead of blindly picking the second message's value

- Version bumped from 1.5.3 to 1.5.4

## v1.5.3

Debug Bundle Export — structured diagnostic data export.

- Added `Diagnostics.exportDebugBundle()` returning structured JSON with meta, system, profile, storage, dom, runtime, liveReader, errors sections
- Bundle uses machine-readable values (numbers, booleans, arrays) instead of display strings
- Added "Copy Debug Bundle" button to Diagnostics UI alongside existing Copy Report and Copy JSON
- Bundle includes LiveReader source/confidence metadata per field
- Bundle includes error history with timestamps
- Diagnostics view now renders nested objects as JSON in the table
- Dashboard and LiveReader behavior unchanged
- Version bumped from 1.5.2 to 1.5.3
